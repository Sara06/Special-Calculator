# Special-Calculator
• Input validation: Prompts the user for an input number. Validates that it is an integer. provides feedback if the number is not valid.
• Mathematical Operations: Upon receiving a valid input, the calculator will perform the following mathematical calculations: Square the input number. (A number squared is a number that is multiplied by itself. For example, 2^2 is equal to 4 (2 * 2)). Calculate the cube of the input number (a number cubed is a number multiplied by itself twice. For example, 23 is equal to 8 (2 * 2 * 2)). i. Calculate the factorial of the number (a factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. For example, factorial four (4!) is equal to 24 (4 * 3 * 2 * 1). 
• Output Display Results:  i. The results of each calculation should be displayed clearly to the user on the interface.  ii. The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive allowing users to easily understand the calculations and results presented.
